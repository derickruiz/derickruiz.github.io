## Volunteer Odyssey
Creating an effective to-do list can be tough. I'm sure you hear countless stories everyday about someone's to-do lists being left unfinished. The reason those tasks haven't been taken care of isn't because of time, but because the doing of them hasn't been defined. Try to think about why you want to accomplish the task, when you're going to start, and how you're going to do it.
