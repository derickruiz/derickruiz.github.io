![Portrait of Derick Ruiz][derick-portrait]

I’m a front-end web developer. I focus on the HTML, CSS, and Javascript part of a website. The what your eyes can see and what your fingers can swipe part of a website. Do I know jQuery? Angular? Bootstrap? Yeah sure, but those are libraries that stand *on top* of the fundamentals. Libraries come and go, but the fundamentals are here to stay. Ultimately, I build user interfaces — a tangible version of showing the user respect — for various mediums using web technologies. UI is the concrete *implementation* of hospitality.

Hospitality involves showing respect for one’s guests, providing for their needs, and most importantly, treating them as equals. It refers to good caring which is where the word *Hospital* stems from. To the ancient greeks, hospitality was a right and the Stoics regarded it as a duty inspired by God himself.

And that’s exactly what I do. I build user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Hospitality comes first, treating users as equal, and *that* gets turned into the UI. I provide to the human being that is caring enough to actually be on my website — you — with that inherent right to a good experience. In essence, I’m a web developer that gives a shit.
