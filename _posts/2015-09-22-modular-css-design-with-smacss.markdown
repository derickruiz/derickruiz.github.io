I gave a talk on August 19th at Meteor Memphis, a web development group in Memphis focused on the Meteor framework, about Modular CSS Design with SMACSS. My friend did me a great favor and filmed it for me. I talk about using the different methodologies that Jonathan Snook talks about in his SMACSS approach to CSS, and how they can drastically improve your CSS.
