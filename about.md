![Portrait of Derick Ruiz][derick-portrait]

I’m a front-end web developer. I focus on the HTML, CSS, and Javascript part of a website. The what your eyes can see and what your fingers can swipe part of a website. Do I know jQuery? Angular? Bootstrap? Yeah sure, but those are libraries that stand *on top* of the fundamentals. Libraries come and go, but the fundamentals are here to stay, for a while at least. Ultimately, I build user interfaces — a tangible version of showing the user respect — for various mediums using web technologies. UI is the concrete *implementation* of hospitality.

According to Wikipedia, hospitality involves showing respect for one’s guests, providing for their needs, and most importantly, treating them as equals. It refers to good caring which is where the word *Hospital* stems from. To the ancient greeks, hospitality was a right and the Stoics regarded it as a duty inspired by God himself.

We all believe equality and showing respect is right in one way or another, but it seems nonexistent on the web as we know it today. Users are not being treated as equals and they are not being shown the respect they deserve. Hundreds of scripts in the head tag of the HTML document with the browser gasping for air, seconds tick by and I still don’t see any content. Social buttons at the top of the page bleeding with desparation for attention before I have even had a chance to know whether I really like the content or not. Finally it can brea - jang! Wait, what's that? A pop up telling me to download a free ebook before I’ve even read an article on your website? *Only if you put in your email!* No thanks. Where’s the x button?

All of these things don't just clog the pipes of the website, they are signs of *disrespect*. Just because I clicked a link to your website doesn’t mean I want to be right hooked in the mouth as soon as I step in the ring. I'll dodge it, so jab me a little bit. Show me some honesty. Show me that you *really* care and aren’t just interested in getting a quick sale.

No longer should the rights of the user be violated while browsing the web. I say let’s go back to the days when websites *just loaded* and displayed content without all the bells and whistles. Let’s show our users some hospitality.

And that’s exactly what I do. I build user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Hospitality comes first, treating users as equal, and *that* gets turned into the UI. I provide to the human being that is caring enough to actually be on my website — you — with that inherent right to a good experience. In essence, **I’m a web developer that gives a shit.**

I am currently a UI developer at Hilton Hotels in Memphis, Tennessee. I spend the rest of my time working on side projects, studying Japanese, and reading. Recently I’m really interested in Jekyll.
