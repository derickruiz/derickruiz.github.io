During GiveCamp Memphis 2015, a weekend-long event where creators donate their time to nonprofit organizations, I helped design and develop a responsive calendar for Volunteer Odyssey. Sarah Petschonek, the director of Volunteer Odyssey, pitched that she needed a new calendar because the one currently in use wasn't mobile friendly. I jumped on the opportunity to help immediately.

GiveCamp works by having teams do standup meetings every few hours to discuss the status of the project, and where itâ€™s going next. We all chose which organization we wanted to help, formed teams, and headed for the first standup meeting.

A group of Ruby on Rails programmers and I got together and immediately got to work after the meeting finished. I remember a feeling of bond and happiness between all of us. We were working together for a higher purpose. To create a great calendar that could be accessed on any device by volunteers and organizations alike. It felt refreshing.

### The Calendar

We forked a repository on Github named [calagator](https://github.com/calagator/calagator) that already had most of the calendar functionality implemented but was missing a few important features that Sarah needed.

- Recurring Events
- The ability for organizations to log in privately through a URL
- A calendar view

Taking care of the design and implementation of the calendar view was my role.

### The Approach

I chose to start with the table view traditionally associated with calendars for desktop and tablet, and then use CSS to break that table view down into a list for mobile devices while still containing all the necessary information. I chose a list for mobile because I thought volunteers checking the calendar on mobile were probably looking for events happening right now or in the very near future. The list view provides just that.

### The Code and Future

You can see the original website [here][original-website]. You can view all the code that went into the project on Github [here](https://github.com/VolunteerOdyssey/calagator). I am actively working on a redesign for the calendar with Sarah. Below is a gif of the redesign's current status. You can keep up with my efforts on the `css-restructure-and-redesign` branch [here](https://github.com/VolunteerOdyssey/calagator/tree/css-restructure-and-redesign).
